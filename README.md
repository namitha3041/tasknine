Task Eight - HTML and Python Registration Form
Project Overview
This project contains two tasks:

HTML Registration Form: A user-friendly form for collecting registration details such as full name, email, password, gender, and date of birth.
Python Script: A Python script that handles user input directly via the terminal, validates input data using regular expressions for email validation and checks for matching passwords.
Contents
index.html: The registration form implemented using HTML and styled with CSS.
app.py: The Python script to process user input. It validates input provided directly from the terminal and displays a success message upon successful registration.
styles.css: The CSS file used to style the registration form.
Prerequisites
Python 3.x
Installing VSCodium
To edit and work with these files, VSCodium was used for syntax highlighting and editing. You can install VSCodium on Kali Linux by running:

sudo apt install -y codium
For more details, visit: VSCodium Official Site.

How to Run the Project
Step 1: Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/taskeight.git
cd taskeight
Step 2: Run the Python Script
The registration process is handled entirely within the terminal. To run the script:

python app.py
Step 3: Validate the HTML File
Open the index.html file in VSCodium. Use the Emmet extension to improve the structure and validation of the HTML code.

Running the Python Script Without python Command
After adding the shebang line (#!/usr/bin/env python3) to the script, make the Python script executable with the following command (if running on a Linux-based OS):

chmod +x app.py
Now, you can run the script directly using:

./app.py
